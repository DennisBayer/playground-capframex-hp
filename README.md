# Welcome to CapFrameX

*CapFrameX* offers a rich feature set to record and analyze GPU and CPU benchmarks.

It enables you to analyze and compare records in multiple ways. The FPS-, Frametime-graphes and L-Shapes are calculated for each record and can be compared among each others. The calculation considers various options, e.g. Shuttering Parameter and Adaptive Scattering Measure.

Although based on PresentMon, which covers all 3D APIs, OCAT records can be imported as well.
