name: Synchronization View
---

This view shows you the quality of your synchronization methods like FreeSync or G-Sync. If they are working properly, the lines for "frametimes" and "Display changed times" should align pretty well, this means your monitor works at the adaptive refresh rate of your GPU. At the bottom you can see the distribution of the refresh times and beside it another pie chart which shows the number of dropped frames.
