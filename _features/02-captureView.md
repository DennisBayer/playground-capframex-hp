name: Capture View
---
 
This is the default view when starting CapFrameX. Here you can set up your capture hotkey, the capture time and the response sounds. An info text at the top always informs you what's going on with the capture service and tells you what to do. For more detailed information about the capture events, you can take a look at the logger expander which is located at the bottom.

## How to make a capture

The process you want to capture has to be present in the "Running processes" list. This list automatically lists all running processes from which frametimes can be captured. For the easiest way of just getting into a game and pressing the hotkey to start a capture, this list may only contain one single process, otherwise the service won't know which process you want captured. If you have more than one process detected, you can still select the one you want and capturing will work just fine. However you wouldn't want to tab out of your game to do this. This is where the ignore list comes into play. You can expand this list by clicking on the text at the bottom of the running processes list. With the arrow buttons you can add or remove any process from the ignore list, the ideal scenario being a completely empty running processes list at the start of CapFrameX. With this, you can just start your game and since it'll be the only process in the list, just push the hotkey.
