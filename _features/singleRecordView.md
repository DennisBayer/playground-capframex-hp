This is where you can analyse the captures you made. You can choose between frametime graphs, FPS graphs, and L-shapes. At the bottom you have your performance parameters like min, max, avg and percentiles. These parameters can be changed in the Data/Chart settings. You also have a pie chart which shows the amount of time you had stuttering, meaning frametimes above 2.5x average. Also at the top you have a screenshot button to save the view(without the record list) as a png file.

Above that is the global menu.

* Moving average window size = The number of frames that are used for the average line in the frametime chart.
* Stuttering factor = The factor a frametime has to be above average to be counted as stutter.
* Observed directory = The directory in which your captures are saved and also where you can put your OCAT captures.
* FPS values rounding digits = The number of decimals for the FPS values
* Screenshot directory = The directory in which your screenshots are saved.
