name: Record List

This list is always located at the left section, regardless of the view you're currently in. It constantly observes the output directory so every capture will show up here as soon as the capture has finished. This also includes every OCAT capture you put into that directory. At the bottom of that list you can see and change the CPU and GPU description and also add a custom comment to every capture.
