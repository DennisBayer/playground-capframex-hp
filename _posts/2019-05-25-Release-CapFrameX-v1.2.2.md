# CapFrameX v1.2.2 released

We are very pleased to announce a new version of *CapFrameX*, featuring new capture page and many analysis functions.

## New features

* Frametimes capture function based on PresentMon. Most common 3D APIs are supported. Very reliable hotkey hooking. Accurate scanning fametime data stream
* Basic hardware info (CPU, GPU, motherboard, system RAM)
* OCAT record analysis (version 1.3 and 1.4)
* New statistical parameter

## Bugfixes

* Crash when reading OCAT records
* Installation instructions
* Warnings from anti-virus software may occur during the installation because I could not configure the application as "ClickOnce Trusted Publishers". CapFrameX is absolutly trustworthy and secure. I'm working on a solution.
